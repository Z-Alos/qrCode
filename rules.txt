# QR CODE:
## Version
-> There are many verison of qr which represents the grid size (large grid means more information):
Version 1: 21x21
Version 2: 25x25
The Latest Version is Version 40: 177x177

## Quite Zone
-> There should be an empty zone just outside the actual qr code

## Position Squares
-> There are 3 squares placedond the edge of the corner on 3 of the 4 corner, it has a stripe which seperates the position squares from 
rest of the qr code info.
Position Square helps the scanner figure out orientation of the qr 

## Alignment Squares
-> It is relatively smaller than the position squares and places on the corner where position square was not placed
It helps rescale the qr code to a perfect square if scanned from a weird perspective

## Timing Squares
-> It helps define the version of the qr code.
If there are 5 alternating squares then it is version 1 and if there's 9 it's version 2

## Format Squares
-> It occupies the space adjacent to the border of the position squares. It defines how the data should be read.


## Data Storage
-> Data is stored in binary in qr and data always start from the bottom right corner and the first 4 bit or squares specify the data format.
Data is stored in a zig zag 2 column format making its way to the top left position square
### There are 4 data formats used in qr codes
-> (0001) Numeric
-> (0010) Alphanumeric
-> (0100) Binary
-> (1000) Japanese Kanji

### Real Shit
-> Following the data format segment there are 8 bits that specifies the number of character in the qr stored
